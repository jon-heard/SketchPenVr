- adjust setup instructions:
  - add instruction to alter pressure gradient (optional step)
    - mention that pressure control is visual instead of tactile, which takes some getting used to: closer to painting than pen drawing
  - update setup pic for handedness for new ui
  - mention smoothness instructions as part of app-specific tutorial in setup
  - add nice starting brush for krita
  - compatibility in alphabetical order
- look for easy ways to make website more appealing (look at each paint app's website for ideas)
- go over entire website once more

- point out website to drakfyre

- try and make RL-Plane align functionality more accurate (look up ways to maximize accuracy: don't move headset, keep headset close to controller, etc)
  - add controls for fine tuning plane that show up while plane locked
    - feature instruction update: bring up these controls

- look for other playtesters

0.2.00.00 - dev
----------
- add an about page with version display

- add in-app console for debugging
  - have it be based on a build define (not set then no console slow-down)

- ActionTypes should have space in name

- have scrollbar react to thumb up/down (necessitates blocking thumb input from main app)

0.2.01.00 - dev
----------
- image panels

- action to fade desktop panel

- save/load scene

0.2.02.00 - dev
----------
- should detect hybrid computer and auto-switch to it if necessary
  - make sure it's obvious to the user that it's running in that mode as it's less performant

- fix shadow in hybrid mode

0.2.03.00 - dev
----------
- desktop panel clip

0.2.04.00 - dev
----------
- controller action presets

- control set update: one page for selecting preset, another for modifying preset

0.2.05.00 - dev
----------
- grip adjustment improvements
  - hold trigger and hover over hand allows gripping pencil and moving it
  - If shake while hovering with trigger, calculates fulcrum and shows red dot at point

- hold trigger and hover over pen highlights pen.  Hovering over tip base highlights that and allows dragging it
  - snaps to presets (with a label showing name of each preset)

0.2.06.00 - dev
----------
- come up with background replacements (borrow Pramod's camera)

- come up with way to get new backgrounds in there

0.2.07.00 - dev
----------
- Try and come up with DD & WGC engines on my own to optimize speed

- experiment with how much mipmapping slows down screen capture (now that we have access to screen capture)

0.3.00. - alpha
----------

0.4.00.000 - beta
----------

1.0.00.00 - release
----------


Miscelaneous todos
------------------
- switch "Vr_Head" and "Vr_Hand" to single system and put into common.  Make it compatible with archery game as much as possible.
- have scrollbar adjust to different item visibility counts (5 items at a time vs 10, for example)
