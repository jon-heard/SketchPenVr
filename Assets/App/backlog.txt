0.1.02.00 - prototype
----------
- fix mouse getting stuck down when moving into range with mouse down

- add transparent overlay to menu
- move set controls over all ui except for settings/options button
- move handedness dropdown as subbutton like I did for other buttons

- experiment with how much mipmapping slows down screen capture

- adjust setup instructions:
  - add instruction to alter pressure gradient (optional step)
    - mention that pressure control is visual instead of tactile, which takes some getting used to: closer to painting than pen drawing
  - update setup pic for handedness for new ui
- test with digital art apps and get ideal settings (on laptop, in case I need to try them again later):
  - clip studio paint

- find smoothness settings for medibang and then update website that it works and instructions
- find optimal settings for each app and add to website
- look for easy ways to make website more appealing (look at each paint app's website for ideas)
- go over entire website once more
- point out website to drakfyre

- try and make RL-Plane align functionality more accurate (look up ways to maximize accuracy: don't move headset, keep headset close to controller, etc)
  - add controls for fine tuning plane that show up while plane locked
    - feature instruction update: bring up these controls

- look for other playtesters

0.2.00.00 - dev
----------
- add an about page with version display

- add in-app console for debugging
  - have it be based on a build define (not set then no console slow-down)

- action to fade desktop panel

- save/load scene

0.2.02.00 - dev
