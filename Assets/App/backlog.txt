0.1.07.00
----------
- ease-out in gradient
  - adjust pressure to match gradient

- moving mouse for over a second disables control until moving controller for over a second (?)

- do painting video

0.1.08.00
----------
- screen waits until headset is at non-0 position, or maybe just once it's changed if it doesn't start at 0

- background material permenantly changes each time it's changed in play mode

- Split App_Details into App_Details and App_Settings

- InputManager: simplify
  - don't start listening (need to set it)
  - don't need Listener AND ListenerTicket (merge them)

- use ScrolledList for dropdown control

- grip button should included in Controller::UnpressAllButtons(), but it's commented out as this
    this messes with dragging in pen-mode.  Fix it so we can include it (in case they use non-drag for grip btn)


0.2.00.00 - dev
----------
- controller action presets

- control set update: one page for selecting preset, another for modifying preset

- have action to switch to a different preset while button is held (allows for multi-button actions)

0.2.01.00 - dev
----------
- add ability to view other windows as panels... maybe that's all I should do, instead of images, youtubes, etc.

- image panels

- action to fade desktop panel

- save/load scene

0.2.02.00 - dev
----------
- ability to add multiple 3d models (sizable and movable with 'hold' actions)
- 3d models are lockable

- comes with preset models: locked into place to make a scene around you

0.2.03.00 - dev
----------
- should detect hybrid computer and auto-switch to it if necessary
  - make sure it's obvious to the user that it's running in that mode as it's less performant

- fix shadow in hybrid mode

- try and make RL-Plane align functionality more accurate (look up ways to maximize accuracy: don't move headset, keep headset close to controller, etc)
  - add controls for fine tuning plane that show up while plane locked
    - feature instruction update: bring up these controls

- add monitor selector (greyed if only one monitor)

0.2.04.00 - dev
----------
- desktop panel clip

0.2.05.00 - dev
----------
- grip adjustment improvements
  - hold trigger and hover over hand allows gripping pen and moving it
  - If shake while hovering with trigger, calculates fulcrum and shows red dot at point

- hold trigger and hover over pen highlights pen.  Hovering over tip base highlights that and allows dragging it
  - snaps to presets (with a label showing name of each preset)

0.2.06.00 - dev
----------
- come up with background replacements (borrow Pramod's camera)

- come up with way to get new backgrounds in there

0.2.07.00 - dev
----------
- Try and come up with DD & WGC engines on my own to optimize speed

- experiment with how much mipmapping slows down screen capture (now that we have access to screen capture)

0.3.00.00 - alpha
----------

0.4.00.000 - beta
----------

1.0.00.00 - release
----------
- feature to paint inside of sphere canvas: sphere mesh with skymap uvs and uses clip to choose subrect to work on
  - need to be able to be consistant about subrect
    - Maybe it snaps based on color on screen texture?
    - maybe clip rect just has ability to be infinitely specific

Miscelaneous todos
------------------
- have scrollbar adjust to different item visibility counts (5 items at a time vs 10, for example)
