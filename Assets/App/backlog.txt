- make tutorial video

- action keys: some have magenta backs
- action keys: not scrolling at extreme angle
- action keys: right-hand thumb directions not working

 Post prototype
----------------
- have scrollbar adjust to different item visibility counts (5 items at a time vs 10, for example)
- have scrollbar react to thumb up/down (necessitates blocking thumb input from main app)
- control set update: one page for selecting preset, another for modifying preset
- add option to download backgrounds from url
- fix console spam

- experiment with feedback during drawing
- add feedback before drawing
- add feedback toggle dropdown in settings
